of Arduinos

Installation procedure
----------------------

Clone or copy this reporistory to your `~/sketchbook/libraries` folder.

On Unix like machines you can just run the following command:

    $ cd ~/sketchbook/libraries && git clone https://github.com/xlcteam/NXTI2CDevice.git

if you have `git` installed.

If you don't, it might be a good idea to download the [zip
file](https://github.com/xlcteam/NXTI2CDevice/archive/master.zip) from GitHub,
extract it somewhere and move the directory `NXTI2CDevice-master` into
`~/sketchbook/libraries/NXTI2CDevice`, where `~` is your home folder on
whatever system you might use.
